# Gradient Background Generator

* Generates a left-to-right gradient based on the colour options selected and displays the CSS code snippet
* Random gradient on page load, and input buttons are set to the respective colours
* Random button chooses 2 colours for the gradient, and the input selector colours update respectively

# Bugs

* Input selector colours don't update when you choose a colour manually, then click the random button
